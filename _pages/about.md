I help individuals, teams and companies to thrive within todayâ€™s (business) complexity.

Often, my experience of 10+ years working with (client) teams as a sytemic designer helps us to navigate from possiblity to reality. Sometimes, my shapeless academic belt of computer science, philosophy, psychology, and archaeology is what really makes the difference.

All of it fuelling my greatest passion: to support others on their way towards future relevance.

Currently, I'm the Global Head of Design at Futurice, an innovation consultancy, where I'm privileged to lead wonderful teams who co-create resilient futures.
